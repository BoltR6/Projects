#THIS PROJECT INTENTIONALLY HAS POOR TYPING AND NAMING

I was extremely bored in AP CS, and was given the classic 'roll a dice' challenge.
This was the product of 8 hours of work, a lot of caffine, and a LOT of adderall.
The poor naming and typing are purposeful, I started the project with the idea of messing with my teacher in mind. PLEASE. Keep that in mind. I, and no-one else, should never do anything like this demon-spawn of code.
