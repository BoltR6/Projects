This was made in AP Physics 1 during the vector section which was overly explained and therefore incredibly boring. 
Calculates and visually displays vectors, as well as a resultant vector from combining all listed vectors (colored green)
You can feed it just 2 of the four variables (x, y, rotation, or distance) and it will calculate the other two, which is kinda cool.
