# A fully function graphing calculator. 

Got bored in calc and decided to create a Desmos clone in JS. Fairly? smooth and efficient, and serves as further proof that RegEx should be considered an esoteric language. Sin and cosine as functions are built in, I may consider adding logs, eulers's constant, constant maniuplation, and PI as a constant in the future in the event that I decide to expand on this and add a derivative feature.
## Features:
- Moveable Viewport 
- Auto-translate a human written function to a set of instructions to be computed
- Accepts poor human notation (IE: 2x^2 = 2*x^2)
- Function PEMDAS Functions > Parenthesis > Exponents > Division > Multiplication > Addition > Subtraction
- Scalable Viewport
- Efficient Computation that builds on viewport
