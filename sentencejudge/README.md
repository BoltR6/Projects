- Mid 2018

One of my first projects with ML and scraping! Please bear in mind I was 13 when I wrote this.
Deals with the old IBM machine learning framework, which while now closed, still functions, as their backend for the project still exists.
Feed it a sentence, and help out the learning by telling it whether or not it was right. The learning network only has a few nodes, but is still effective for the purpose it serves.
