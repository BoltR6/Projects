- Early 2022

A piece of software that I wrote to calculate the best possible starting word for wordle.
There are three different generations with efficiency drastically increasing between each new iteration.
Proof of concept for situations where a massive amount of computations are made and must be efficized, as well as some memory management and (sorta?) machine learning.

It's also a solver that's really efficient, but to be honest, that was not the difficult part of the project. I really enjoyed making this, and I encourage any readers to attempt the same challenge :D

Two files are excluded from this push, that being all.txt and noat.txt, as they are documents over 1gb each with data on what to and not to use in computations, as well as previous computations to further efficize new ones. If you'd like to have a copy of these files, feel free contact me at Bolt#0001 on discord!
