A piece of software that I wrote to calculate the best possible word for wordle.
Three different generations with efficiency drastically increasing between each new iteration.
Proof of concept for situations where a massive amount of computations are made and must be efficized, as well as some memory management and (sorta?) machine learning.

It's also a solver that's really efficient, but to be honest, that was not the difficult part of the project. I really enjoyed making this, and I encourage any readers to attempt the same challenge :D
