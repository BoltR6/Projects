It's extremely efficient and works well for high tile count maps as well. This served as the inspiration for my Dune II clone, as I remembered wondering how it worked as a kid. 

## Features:
- Diagonals (press a key)
- 20ms calculation time on average 
- Takes any size/dimension map as input
- Open to adding a priority direction
- Low memory usage
